//PROCESS STATE - NEW STSTE GENERATION TO TERMINATION 
NEW STATE - JAB KOI PROGRAM PROCESS ME CONVERT HORHI H USSE BOLTE H
READY STATE - PROCESS BNN CHUKI H AND MEMORY ME READY QUEUE ME JATI H , CPU KE EXECUTIONN KA WAIT KRRHI H
RUNNING STATE - CPU ALLOCATED 
WAITING STATE - WAIT FOR I/O COMPLITION
TERMINATION STATE - PROCESS ENDED 

//type of schedular 
1.STS - (SHORT TERM SCHEDULAR ) - CPU SCHEDULAR

2. LTS )LONG TERM SCHEDULAR) - JOB SCHEDULAR IN SECONDARY STORAGE 

3. MTS (MEDIUM TERM SCHEDULAR ) - DEGREE OF MULTI PROGRAMMING INCREASE BY LTS SWAP OUT SOME OF THE PROCESS COZ MEMORY GOT FULL
SWAP OUT AND RETURN IT BACK TO READY  QUEUE BY SWAP IN IF IT'S NEEDED

//DEGREE OF MULTI PROGRAMMING CONTROL NY LTS ( LONG TERM SCHEDULAR )


//SWAPPING - SWAP OUT SOME OF THE JOB TO SECONDARY STORAGE  AND PROGRAM GOT EXECUTED WE SWAP IN THESE JOBS 
//CONTEXT SWITCHING -CPU HAS TO CONTEXT SWITCHING IF THE PROGRAM GOES TO LET SUPPOSE I/O PERFORMING THEN IN THAT
CASE IT SAVE THE CONTEXT IN CORRESPONDING PCB AND REGISTERS 
AND IT DONE BY KARNAL .(CHANGE THE FOCUS )
//ORPHAN PROCESS -











//PROCESS SCHEDULING -  L.T.S BRING ALL THE PROCESSES -> READY QUEUE HAVE DIFFERENT PROCESS(LIKE P1, P2 , P3....)-> S.T.S PICK ONE OF THE PROCESS
FROM READY QUEUE AND DISPATCH IT -> CPU AFTER EXECTUTION -> PROCESS BACK TO READY QUEUE OR IN WAITING STATE IF I/O IS HAPPENING

*CPU SCHEDULAR PICK OUT OF ALL THE PROCESSES FROM READY QUEUE AND BRING IT IN THE CPU
*PROCESS SHEDULING ALGORITHUM - USE TO INFORME WHICH PROCESS IS GOING TO BE CHOOSEN FROM READY QUEUE

THEIR ARE TWO TYPE OF SCHEDULING ALOGRITHUM -
1. NON - PREUMPT :- AFTER P ASSIGNED TO CPU THEN P LEFT ONLY WHEN IT GOT TERMINATED OR ELSE WHEN IT GOT INOTWAIT STATE AND
IT HAS HIGH STARVATION , LOW CPU UTLIZATION , LOW OVERHEAD
2.PREUMPMT :- ABOVE TWO WAYS ARE INCLUDED WITH THAT WHEN TIME QUANTUM GOT EXPIRE THEN ALSO P LEFT THE CPU BUT
IT HAS LOW STARVATION , HIGH CPU UTILIZATION ,  IT HAS HIGH OVERHEAD( CHAMGING OF PROCESS HAS A TIME BOUNG)

//GOAL OF CPU SCHEDULARS :-
1. MAX CPU UTLIZATION
2.MIN TURN AROUND TIME( TIME GAP WHEN P ENTERS THE CPU AND TIME WHEN IT GOT TERMINATED AFTER EXECUTION) = CT - AT
3.MIN WAIT TIME (P SE WAIT KAM KAM FOR CPU
4. MIN RESPONSE TIME (TIME GAP WHEN P ENTER IN READY TIME AND IT GOT CUP FOR THE FIRST TIME)
5.MA THROUGHPUT (MAX NO. OF PROCESSEs COMPLETED IN PER UNIT TIME)
*ARRIVAL TIME(AT) - TIME WHEN PROCESS CAME AT PRIORITY QUEUE
*BURST TIME (BT) - TIME REQUIRED BY TIME PROCESS FOR ITS EXECUTION
*WAIT TIME (WT) - TIME PROCESS SPEND WAITING FOR CPU . TAT - BT
*COMPLETION TIME(CT) - TIME TAKEN TILL PROCESS GOT TERMINATED

//SCHEDULING A;GORITHUM -
1.FCFS(FISRT COME FISRT SERVICE) - JO VPROCESS SBSE PHLE AAYI H WO DESPACHER KO BOLEGA CPU KO ASSIGN KRNE KO
--- THIS FCFS HAS A BIG ISSUE CALLED CONVO EFFECT 
*CONVOY EFFECT - IF A PROCESS AHS HIGH BT THEN IT AFFECT ON THE AVE. WT OF DIFFERENT PROCESS
2.SJF(SORTEST JOB FIRST) - SBSE CHHOTA BT  JISKA H IN QUEUE USSE HM CPU KO DE DENGE
