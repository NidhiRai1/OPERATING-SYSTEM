DUE TO THREAD LOCK , MUTUAL EXCLUSION THEIR IS ABUG ARISES CALLED DEADLOCK

WE CAN SAY THAT IN SYYSTEM THEIR AREA LOTS OF RESOURCE , AND TO USE THEM PROCESSES AND THREADS ARE COMPETTING IN MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE WAY

DEADLOCK - 2 OR MORE PROCESS ARE WAITING FOR RESOURCE AVAILABLILITY WHICH WILL NEVER AVAILABLE i.e BUSY WITH SOMEOTHER PROCESS

//HOW PROCESS/THREAD UTILIZE A RESOURCE 
1.REQUEST - FOR RESOURCE 
2. USE - CHECK THE AVAILIBLE - (LOACK AVAILABLE OR NOT ) 
3.RELEASE WHEN THAT USE BY THAT THREAD BY MAKING IT UNLOCK FOR OTHER THREAD/PROCESS

//CONDITION FOR DEADLOCK(SIMULTENIOUSLLY TRUE ALL THE CONDITION)
1.MUTUAL EXCLUSION - (EK BAR ME EK HI TREAD /PROCESS USE KREGI KOI V RESOURCE)
2.HOLD & WAIT - (
3.NO PREUMTION - (UNTILL TREAD / PROCESS COMPLETE THEIR EXECUTION NO OTHER THREAD CAN'T ACCESS THAT RESOURCE)
4.CIRCULAR WAIT - WAITING IS IN KIND OF CIRCULAR FASHION 

//DEADLOCK DETECTION :- 
1,SINGLE INSTANCE OF EACH RESOURSE :- WAIT FOR GRAPH SE RESOURSE AND PROCESS KI EDGES HTAA DETI H P1 WAITING FOR THAT RESOURSE THAT  IS WAITING FO RP2 AND VISE VERSA 
IF CYCLE IS FORMED THEN THEN DEADLOCK
2.MULTIPLE INSTANCE :- WITH TEH HELP OF BANKER ALLOGRITHUM IF WE FIND SAFE SEQUENCE THEN NO DL ELSE THEIR IS A DL

//DEADLOCK RECOVERY :- 
1.PROCESS TERMINATION - ABOT ALL THE DL OR ABOT ONE PROCESS(LESS PRIVORITY ) AT A TIME UNTLI THEN DL CYCLE GOT RLIMINATED
2.RESOURCE PREMPTION :- WE PREMPT SOME RESOURSES FROM THE PROCESS AND GIVE IT OT THE OYJER PROCESS TO AVOID DL


//RESOURCE ALLOCATION GRAPH - IT'S LIKE A GRAPH 
VERTEX - PROCESS AND RESOURCE VERTEX
EDGES - ASSIGNE AND REQUEST EDGE  USE FOR GRAPHICAL REPRESANTATION 


//ISOLATION AND MEMEORY PROTECTION:-OS VIRTUAL MEMORY(LOGICAL MEMEORY) KO ALLOCATE KRTA H PHYSICAL ADDRESS SPACE(IN MAIN MEMORY) ME 
      FOR ISOLATION OS HAS TO STORE BASE AND OFFSET WITH THE HELP OF THESE OS GETS THAT IN THE PHYSICAL 
SPACE THE ALLOCATED ADDRESS FOR PROCESS IS IN RANGE OF BASE , MAX BOUND ADDRESS ASIGN 
  BSE STORE IN RELOCATION REGISTER AND CHANGE THROUGH CONTEXT SWITCHING


//ALLOCATION IN PHYSICAL MEMORY
1.CONTEGIOUS MEMORY ALOCATION :- PROCESS ARE PUTTED IN THE CONTINUAS AMNNER IN THE PHYSICAL MEMORY 
A. FIXED PARTITIONING IN RAM OF EQUAL SIZING TAKI PROCESS KO ALLOCATE KRPAYE

//THESE PARTATIONING CAUSE :-
*INTERNNAL FRAGMENTATION - HAAR PARTITION KE ANDAR V FRAGMENTATION H 
*EXTERNAL FRAGMENTATION - SARE PARTATION KO COMBINE KRO TO V THEIR IS FRAGMENTATION
   *COZ OF WHICH WE CAN'T USE SPACE IN OPTIMIZED WAY
*DEGREE OF MUTLI PROGRAMMING(NO. OF PROCESS ) IS KESS

B. DYNAMIC PARTITIONING - EK PARTITIONING KITE SIZE KI H WO FIX NI HOTI ACCORDING TO OUR NEED WE ADJUST THE SIZE IN THE CONTINOUS  FRAGMENTTION
  IT'S BETTER THEN FIXED PARTITIONING 

//LIMITATION 
EXTERNAL FRAGMENTATION 



//DEFRAGMENTATION :- FREE SPACE EK SIDE PE AND ALL THE ALLICATION ARE AT ONE SIDE DONE BY OS BUT USER DON'T KNOW 
ABOUT IT , BUT DEFRAGMENTATION MAKE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE SYSTEM LESS AND IT;S ATIME CONSUMING PROCESS

//ALLOCATION IN FREE SPACES OF HOLE 
1, FIRST FIT :- 10 -> 100 -> 90 -> NULL , FIRST HOLE  THAT ABLE TO ALLOCATE THIS 90 THEN FREE SPACE 
10 -> 10 -> 90 -> NULL 

//ADVANTAGES :- FAST , EASY TO IMPLEMENT
2.NEXT FIT ;- FOR 5 IS F'S OF ABOVE 10 -> 5 -> 90 -> NILL
//ADVANTAGES :- FAST
3.BEST FIT :- SMALLEST HOLE WHICH IS BIG ENOUGH :- 10 -> 1000 -> 90 -> NULL   ALLOCATE 90 THEN F.S 10 ->100 -> NULL
//ADVANTAGES :- LOW INTERNAL FRAGMENTATION  AND IT'S SLOW  &&& CREAT MAJOR EXTERNAL FRAGMENTATION (DISADV)
4.WORST FIR - LARGEST HOLE WHICH IS BIG ENOUGH FOR 90 IN 10 -> 200 -> 90 -> NULL THEN F.S 10 -> 110 -> 90 -> NULL
 //ADVANTAGES :- LOW EXTERNAL FRAGMENTATION 
BUT SLOW AND MAJOR INTERNAL FRAGMENTATION
