# OPERATING-SYSTEM
SIMPLE NOTES


//WHY OS -- GET SOME % TO ONE APPLICATION SO IT HELP IN memeory/rSOURCE MANAGMENT and help them to not become bulky 
OS ACT AS INTERFACE b/w user and resouce .
it inhance the security and isolation .

//what is os - it is a piece of software that manage the resources i.e hardware & software and enhacing the efficiency by hiding the underlying complexity of hardware and act as resource amanager .

//GOALS OF OS -
*MAX CPU UTILIZATION(CPU KHALI NA BAITHE)
*PROCESS STARVATION (SARE JOBS KO MOKA MILE)
*HIGH PRIORITY JOB EXECUTION (LIKE ANTI WIRAS EXECTUTION PHLE ISS KRLE BAKI SBKO CHHOD KE )

//types of os -
1.SINGLE PROCESS OS - EK BAR ME EK HI JOB EXECUTE HOGI USKE KHTM HONE KE BAAD DUSRI JOB START HONGI .
2.BATCH PROCESSING - 
3.MULTI PROGRAMMING OS - J1 IN WATING AND J2 IN OS EXECUTIONS
4.











//WHAT HAPPEN WHEN U TURN ON UR COMPTURE 
1. POWER ON
2. CPU INITILOZED BIOS KA PROGRAM SEARCH KREGA
3. BIOS /UEFI (BASIC SET UP FOR COMPTURE CHIP) LOAD THE SETTING POST POWER ON SELF TEST , CMOS BATTERY BACKUP
4. PROGRAM LOAD IF EVERY THING IS FINE 
5. BOOT LOADER IS THE PROGRAM TO LOAD THE
6. BOOT LOADER KA PROGRAM AT MASTER BOOT RECORD MBR IS AT 0 INDEX BUT UEFI STORE THE PROGRAM IN THE PARTITION IN THE MEMORY
7.WINDOWS BOOT MGR.EXE 


//COMPONENT OF OS
1. USER SPACE - NO ACCESS OF HARDWARE , CONVINENT OPTION TO USER APPS 
*GUI(GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE)-

*CLT(COMMAND LINE INTERFACE) -

//SOFTWARE INTERUP - INTRUPUT GENERATED BY SOFTWARE WHEN SWITCHING FROM USER AND KARNAL MODE
USER SPACE INTERACT WITH -> KARNEL INTERACT WITH-> HARDWARE
2.KARNAL - ACCESS OF UNDERLINE AND INTERACT HARDWARE , HEART OF OS 

//FUNCTION OF KARNEL -
--PROCESS MAMNGMENT( CREAT ,EXECUT , COMMUNICATION AMONG THEM)
--MEMEORY MANANGEMRNT (ALLOCATION AND DELETION , FREE SPACE IDEA )
--FILE MANAGMENT (CREAT , DELETE )
--I/O MANAGMENT (SPOOLING , CACHING , BUFFERING)

//TYPE OF KARNAL-
1.MONOLITHIC KARNAL - ALL IN KARNAL FILE , MRMORY , I/O , FILE
FAST COMMUNICATION (MOST OF THINGS AT ONE PLACE ) 
BUT IT'S LESS RELIABLE AND MORE BULKEY 
EG - LINIXINTERAFCE IS THE MECHENISM TO PROVIDE IT USER SOACE 

2.MICRO KARNAL - WE KEEP ONLY CORE FUNCTIONALLITY IN KARNAL LIKE MEMORE AND PROCESS MANGAMENT AND REST 2 IN USER SPACE 
*ADVANTAGE -
BECOME LESS BULKY 
MORE RELIABLE 
*DISADVANTAGE - LESS PERFORMANCE BECAUSE OVERHEAD INCREASE (DUE TO SWITCHING)

3.HYBRUDE - BY COMBINING TWO OR MORE KARNAL WE NEED TO FIND NEW ONE 
HIGH SPEED , HIGH PERFORMANCE  eg - MACOS
//COMMINICATION B/W USER AND KARNAL MODE
IPC (INTER - PROCESS COMMUNICATION ) TWO INDEPENDENTLY EXECUTING PROCESS KE BICH COMMUNICATION KRTE H (LIKE B/W KARNAL AND ISER SPACE )

HOW DO APP INTERACT WITH KARNAL BY TJE HELP OF SYSTEM CALL
//SYSTEM CALL - IT IS A MACHENISM OF PROVIDING AN INTERFACE OR COMMINICATE B/W USER SPACE AND KARNAL COZ IT HAS A HARDWARE ACCESS AND AFTER WORK IS MODE THEN WE SWITCH TO  USER MODE WITH THE HELP OF SOFTWARE INTERUPT
IM -> KM -> UM

// TYPE OF 
1.PROCESS MANAGMENT -  CREATING , DELETE , LOCATING DELOCATING THE PROCESS .
eg -window - creatprocess() , exitprocess()  &&&& mac - exit() , fork() (craet a child of theprocess)
2.FILE MANAGMENT - DELETE , CREAT ,GET SET ATTRUBUTE - PERMISSION SETTING FOR USERS  
eg - windows - creatfile() , exitfile() &&&&&  mac -  open() , closs()
3.DEVICE MANAGMENT - READ WRITE THE DATA
eg - window - setconsolmode() , readconsol()  &&&&& mac - read() , write() 
4. INFORMATION MANAGMENT - FOR SETTING THE TIME 
eg - window - settimer() , sleep()   &&&&  mac - sleep() ,alarm()
5.COMMUNICATION MANAGEMNT - RELATED TO IPC COMMUNICATING WTH DIFFERENT PROCESSES OR COMBINING THEM
eg - window - creatpipe()  &&&&  mac - pipe() .




//32 and 64 bi OS --
 32 BIT KA DATA HOLD KETI H CPU AT  A TIME AND FOR THAT 32 BIT OF HARDWARE IS THEIR AS WELL 32 BIT SOFTWARE IS NEEDED ,A 32 BIT CUP SUPPOET ONLY 4GB RAM ONLY (2^32)
 64 BIT KA DATA HOLD KARTA HAI 
 ---ADVANTAGES 
 *32 BIT CUP HOLD 2^32 LOCATIONS 
 *FOE 64 BIT CPU 2^64 - 1 ADDRESS ALLOCATED 
 *RESOURCE USES IS BETTER IN 64 BIT
 *PERFORMANCE IS BETTER OR FAST COZ IT CAN PROCESS LARGE NO. OF DATA AT A TIME 


 //STORAGES UNIT IN COMPUTER
 *PRIMARY MEMEORY
 1.REGISTER(SMALLEST UNIT OF STORAGE) - CLOSS TO CPU AND FAST TO ACCESS
 2.CACHE - USE TO STORE TEMPORARY MEMORY (TEMPORARY INSTRUCTION AND DATA ETC)
 3.MAIN MEMORY - RAM CUP TALK TO MAIN MEMOY AND GET ALL THE INSTRUCTION 
 *SECONDARY MEMORY - HARDDISC , PROGRAM , AUDIO , VIDEO ARE STORED HERE 
1.SSD - IT IS MODT FATER IN THE SECONDARY MEMORY

COST - REGISTER(HIGH)  -> CACHE - > MAIN MEMORY -> SECONDARY MEMORY (LOW)
ACESS - REGISTER (HIGH) -> CASHE -> MAIN MEMORY -> SECONDARY MEMOMRY (LOW)
STORAGE SIZE - SECONDARY (HIHG)-> MAIN MEMORY -> CACHE -> REGISTER (LOW)



//how os creat a process  STEPS
1.load a program and static data(use for initilization) to the main memory (RAM)
2.ALLOCATE RUN TIME STACK (COPY THE PARENT DATA IN THE STCAK) WHERE STACK IS A PART OF MEMORY USE FOR LOCAL VARIABLE , FUNCTION ARGUMENT AND RETURN VALUE  . 
3.PART OF MEMORYALLOCATE HEAP FOR DYNAMIC DATA 
4.I/O RELATED TASK - I3 DISCRIPTER IS GENERATED FOR INPUT , OUTPUT OR ERROR THEY ARE /O READING , O/P HANDLE AND ERROR HANDLE
5.OS HANDOFF CONTROL TO MAIN (OS KA KAM KHTM)

//ARTICHUTURE OF PROCESS :-
STACK(ON TOP)  -> HEAP -> DATA SECTION (GLOBAL AND STATIC)-> TEXT(COMPILED CODE)
--STACK OVERFLOW - IF THEIR IS NO EXIT CASE THENSTACK OVERFLOW 
STACK UNWINDING (RESOLVE THE STACK OVERFLOW)
--OUT OF MEMORY ERROR - HEAP ALLOCATION IS KEEP ON GOING THEN HEAP TOUCH ON STACK AND ERROR OCCUR (DUE TO MEMORY KHTM)
DEALLOCATE THE UNNECESSERY OBJECTS


//ATTRIBUTE OF PROCESS (KIC V PROCESS KO IDENTIFY KRNE KE LIYE UNJE ALAG ALAG FEATURES)
OS WRITE ALL THE PROCESS IN THE PROCESS TABLE 
EACH PROCESS TABLE ENTRY IS CALLED PROCESS CONTROL BLOCK (PCB ) 
PROCESS KO PEHCHANE KELIYE USKE PCB PE JANA PDEGA
PCB IS A DATA STRUCTURE 
PROCESS ID - UNIQUE IDENTIFIER USE TO INDENTIFY DIFF. PROCESS
PROGRAM COUNTER - FETCH THE INCTRUCTION -> PC++ -> EXECTUTE THE INSTRUCTION DECODED
PROCESS STATE - 
PRIVORITY - HIGH ORIVORT IS NEEDED TO EXECUTED FIRST
REGISTERS - SRACK POINTERS (SP) , BASE POINTER (BP)
OPEN FILE LIST- FILES ARE OPEN WHICH TO WRITE OR READ TOH KON KON C FILES OPEN H.
