# OPERATING-SYSTEM
SIMPLE NOTES


//WHY OS -- GET SOME % TO ONE APPLICATION SO IT HELP IN memeory/rSOURCE MANAGMENT and help them to not become bulky 
OS ACT AS INTERFACE b/w user and resouce .
it inhance the security and isolation .

//what is os - it is a piece of software that manage the resources i.e hardware & software and enhacing the efficiency by hiding the underlying complexity of hardware and act as resource amanager .

//GOALS OF OS -
*MAX CPU UTILIZATION(CPU KHALI NA BAITHE)
*PROCESS STARVATION (SARE JOBS KO MOKA MILE)
*HIGH PRIORITY JOB EXECUTION (LIKE ANTI WIRAS EXECTUTION PHLE ISS KRLE BAKI SBKO CHHOD KE )

//types of os -
1.SINGLE PROCESS OS - EK BAR ME EK HI JOB EXECUTE HOGI USKE KHTM HONE KE BAAD DUSRI JOB START HONGI .
2.BATCH PROCESSING - 
3.MULTI PROGRAMMING OS - J1 IN WATING AND J2 IN OS EXECUTIONS
4,

















//COMPONENT OF OS
1. USER SPACE - NO ACCESS OF HARDWARE , CONVINENT OPTION TO USER APPS 
*GUI(GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE)-

*CLT(COMMAND LINE INTERFACE) -

//SOFTWARE INTERUP - INTRUPUT GENERATED BY SOFTWARE WHEN SWITCHING FROM USER AND KARNAL MODE
USER SPACE INTERACT WITH -> KARNEL INTERACT WITH-> HARDWARE
2.KARNAL - ACCESS OF UNDERLINE AND INTERACT HARDWARE , HEART OF OS 

//FUNCTION OF KARNEL -
--PROCESS MAMNGMENT( CREAT ,EXECUT , COMMUNICATION AMONG THEM)
--MEMEORY MANANGEMRNT (ALLOCATION AND DELETION , FREE SPACE IDEA )
--FILE MANAGMENT (CREAT , DELETE )
--I/O MANAGMENT (SPOOLING , CACHING , BUFFERING)

//TYPE OF KARNAL-
1.MONOLITHIC KARNAL - ALL IN KARNAL FILE , MRMORY , I/O , FILE
FAST COMMUNICATION (MOST OF THINGS AT ONE PLACE ) 
BUT IT'S LESS RELIABLE AND MORE BULKEY 
EG - LINIXINTERAFCE IS THE MECHENISM TO PROVIDE IT USER SOACE 

2.MICRO KARNAL - WE KEEP ONLY CORE FUNCTIONALLITY IN KARNAL LIKE MEMORE AND PROCESS MANGAMENT AND REST 2 IN USER SPACE 
*ADVANTAGE -
BECOME LESS BULKY 
MORE RELIABLE 
*DISADVANTAGE - LESS PERFORMANCE BECAUSE OVERHEAD INCREASE (DUE TO SWITCHING)

3.HYBRUDE - BY COMBINING TWO OR MORE KARNAL WE NEED TO FIND NEW ONE 
HIGH SPEED , HIGH PERFORMANCE  eg - MACOS
//COMMINICATION B/W USER AND KARNAL MODE
IPC (INTER - PROCESS COMMUNICATION ) TWO INDEPENDENTLY EXECUTING PROCESS KE BICH COMMUNICATION KRTE H (LIKE B/W KARNAL AND ISER SPACE )

HOW DO APP INTERACT WITH KARNAL BY TJE HELP OF SYSTEM CALL
//SYSTEM CALL - IT IS A MACHENISM OF PROVIDING AN INTERFACE OR COMMINICATE B/W USER SPACE AND KARNAL COZ IT HAS A HARDWARE ACCESS AND AFTER WORK IS MODE THEN WE SWITCH TO  USER MODE WITH THE HELP OF SOFTWARE INTERUPT
IM -> KM -> UM

// TYPE OF 
1.PROCESS MANAGMENT -  CREATING , DELETE , LOCATING DELOCATING THE PROCESS .
eg -window - creatprocess() , exitprocess()  &&&& mac - exit() , fork() (craet a child of theprocess)
2.FILE MANAGMENT - DELETE , CREAT ,GET SET ATTRUBUTE - PERMISSION SETTING FOR USERS  
eg - windows - creatfile() , exitfile() &&&&&  mac -  open() , closs()
3.DEVICE MANAGMENT - READ WRITE THE DATA
eg - window - setconsolmode() , readconsol()  &&&&& mac - read() , write() 
4. INFORMATION MANAGMENT - FOR SETTING THE TIME 
eg - window - settimer() , sleep()   &&&&  mac - sleep() ,alarm()
5.COMMUNICATION MANAGEMNT - RELATED TO IPC COMMUNICATING WTH DIFFERENT PROCESSES OR COMBINING THEM
eg - window - creatpipe()  &&&&  mac - pipe() .




//32 and 64 bi OS --
 32 BIT KA DATA HOLD KETI H CPU AT  A TIME AND FOR THAT 32 BIT OF HARDWARE IS THEIR AS WELL 32 BIT SOFTWARE IS NEEDED ,A 32 BIT CUP SUPPOET ONLY 4GB RAM ONLY (2^32)
 64 BIT KA DATA HOLD KARTA HAI 
 ---ADVANTAGES 
 *32 BIT CUP HOLD 2^32 LOCATIONS 
 *FOE 64 BIT CPU 2^64 - 1 ADDRESS ALLOCATED 
 *RESOURCE USES IS BETTER IN 64 BIT
 *PERFORMANCE IS BETTER OR FAST COZ IT CAN PROCESS LARGE NO. OF DATA AT A TIME 


 //STORAGES UNIT IN COMPUTER
 *PRIMARY MEMEORY
 1.REGISTER(SMALLEST UNIT OF STORAGE) - CLOSS TO CPU AND FAST TO ACCESS
 2.CACHE - USE TO STORE TEMPORARY MEMORY (TEMPORARY INSTRUCTION AND DATA ETC)
 3.MAIN MEMORY - RAM CUP TALK TO MAIN MEMOY AND GET ALL THE INSTRUCTION 
 *SECONDARY MEMORY - HARDDISC , PROGRAM , AUDIO , VIDEO ARE STORED HERE 
1.SSD - IT IS MODT FATER IN THE SECONDARY MEMORY

COST - REGISTER(HIGH)  -> CACHE - > MAIN MEMORY -> SECONDARY MEMORY (LOW)
ACESS - REGISTER (HIGH) -> CASHE -> MAIN MEMORY -> SECONDARY MEMOMRY (LOW)
STORAGE SIZE - SECONDARY (HIHG)-> MAIN MEMORY -> CACHE -> REGISTER (LOW)
