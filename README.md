# OPERATING-SYSTEM
SIMPLE NOTES


//WHY OS -- GET SOME % TO ONE APPLICATION SO IT HELP IN memeory/rSOURCE MANAGMENT and help them to not become bulky 
OS ACT AS INTERFACE b/w user and resouce .
it inhance the security and isolation .

//what is os - it is a piece of software that manage the resources i.e hardware & software and enhacing the efficiency by hiding the underlying complexity of hardware and act as resource amanager .

//GOALS OF OS -
*MAX CPU UTILIZATION(CPU KHALI NA BAITHE)
*PROCESS STARVATION (SARE JOBS KO MOKA MILE)
*HIGH PRIORITY JOB EXECUTION (LIKE ANTI WIRAS EXECTUTION PHLE ISS KRLE BAKI SBKO CHHOD KE )

//types of os -
1.SINGLE PROCESS OS - EK BAR ME EK HI JOB EXECUTE HOGI USKE KHTM HONE KE BAAD DUSRI JOB START HONGI .
2.BATCH PROCESSING - 
3.MULTI PROGRAMMING OS - J1 IN WATING AND J2 IN OS EXECUTIONS
4,

















//COMPONENT OF OS
1. USER SPACE - NO ACCESS OF HARDWARE , CONVINENT OPTION TO USER APPS 
*GUI(GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE)-

*CLT(COMMAND LINE INTERFACE) -

//SOFTWARE INTERUP - INTRUPUT GENERATED BY SOFTWARE WHEN SWITCHING FROM USER AND KARNAL MODE
USER SPACE INTERACT WITH -> KARNEL INTERACT WITH-> HARDWARE
2.KARNAL - ACCESS OF UNDERLINE AND INTERACT HARDWARE , HEART OF OS 

//FUNCTION OF KARNEL -
--PROCESS MAMNGMENT( CREAT ,EXECUT , COMMUNICATION AMONG THEM)
--MEMEORY MANANGEMRNT (ALLOCATION AND DELETION , FREE SPACE IDEA )
--FILE MANAGMENT (CREAT , DELETE )
--I/O MANAGMENT (SPOOLING , CACHING , BUFFERING)

//TYPE OF KARNAL-
1.MONOLITHIC KARNAL - ALL IN KARNAL FILE , MRMORY , I/O , FILE
FAST COMMUNICATION (MOST OF THINGS AT ONE PLACE ) 
BUT IT'S LESS RELIABLE AND MORE BULKEY 

2.MICRO KARNAL - WE KEEP ONLY CORE FUNCTIONALLITY IN KARNAL LIKE MEMORE AND PROCESS MANGAMENT AND REST 2 IN USER SPACE 
*ADVANTAGE -
BECOME LESS BULKY 
MORE RELIABLE 
*DISADVANTAGE - LESS PERFORMANCE BECAUSE OVERHEAD INCREASE (DUE TO SWITCHING)

//COMMINICATION B/W USER AND KARNAL MODE
IPC (INTER - PROCESS COMMUNICATION )
